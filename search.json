When I wear my PhD hat in the Reading and Language Lab, I’m advised by Rebecca Treiman, working closely with Brett Kessler, where we study (very generally) patterns in children and adults’ spelling. When I wear my data fellow hat, I explore the university’s usage of educational technologies with Sally Wu at the Center for Teaching and Learning.\nI use this site to communicate what I do for work and play, as well as share tools or tricks that some floundering R learner might stumble upon some day and find mildly helpful. If you’re that floundering R learner, don’t worry, we’ve all been there; you’ll get through this error just in time for a new one to yell at you.\nIf you’re interested in more, please do hesitate to get in touch (unless you want to offer me a job, in which case, see here and here). I’m probably busy being overcommitted to things and really just wanting to read novels and catch up on Oscar nominations."
