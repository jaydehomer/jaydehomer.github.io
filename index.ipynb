You can head over to my [Projects](https://jaydehomer.github.io/projects.html) for a quick overview of my current academic projects and check out my blog, where I play around with fun data, explain parts of my process, and answer questions about things I'm personally interested in; you might learn something about Taylor Swift, birds, books, [dogs](https://jaydehomer.github.io/zaya.html), or a cool package in R. Have fun exploring and don't hesitate to [reach out](https://jaydehomer.github.io/contact.html) with questions, job offers, or fun conversations!\n",
