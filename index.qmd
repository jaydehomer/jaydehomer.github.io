Hi, my name is Jayde. I have always loved consuming stories and solving puzzles. Unfortunately, neither of those pay the bills. Unless...

*data is the puzzle and I tell its story.*



## Current Projects

### Understanding Patterns in Preschoolers' Spellings

In my dissertation I am... 


### Parameterized Reports for Department Use of Ed. Tech.

I'll describe that here...

## Experience

I work with Rebecca Treiman and Brett Kessler for 5 years studying children's spelling patterns in children and adults' spelling. 

I also work with Sally Wu at Wash U's Center for Teaching and Learning where I explore the faculty, staff, and students' use of licensed educational technologies. 

I teach stats with R as a private tutor. 

## Education 

I hold a Bachelor's degrees in Brain & Cognitive Sciences and Linguistics (University of Rochester), a Master's degree in Psychology, (almost) a PhD in Psychology (Washington University in St. Louis).
