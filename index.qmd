:::{#hero-heading}

I have always loved consuming stories and solving puzzles. Unfortunately, neither of those pay my dog's dermatology bills or the rent. Unless data is the puzzle and I tell its story.

<p>*As of November, 2023, I began my position as a [Statistical Data Analyst at Wash U](https://insideartsci.wustl.edu/people/jayde-homer). I'm excited to help make data-driven decisions that supports graduate student success. *&#x1F389;</p>

:::

You're probably here because you want to know more about what I'm up to. You can head over to my [Projects](https://jaydehomer.github.io/projects.html) for a quick overview of my academic projects and check out my blog, where I play around with fun data, explain parts of my process, and answer questions about things I'm personally interested in; you might learn something about Taylor Swift, birds, books, [dogs](https://jaydehomer.github.io/zaya.html), or a cool package in R. Have fun exploring and don't hesitate to [reach out](https://jaydehomer.github.io/contact.html) with questions or gentle critiques.
