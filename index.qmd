I have always loved consuming stories and solving puzzles. Unfortunately, neither of those pay my dog's dermatology bills or the rent. Unless...

<p class="text-right" style="background-color: aliceblue"><b>data is the puzzle and I tell its story.</b></p>

You're probably here because you want to know more about what I'm up to. You can head over to my [Projects](https://jaydehomer.github.io/projects.html) for a quick overview of my current academic projects and check out my blog, where I play around with fun data, explain parts of my process, and answer questions about things I'm personally interested in; you might learn something about Taylor Swift, birds, books, [dogs](https://jaydehomer.github.io/zaya.html), or a cool package in R. Have fun exploring and don't hesitate to [reach out](https://jaydehomer.github.io/contact.html) with questions, job offers, or fun conversations!
