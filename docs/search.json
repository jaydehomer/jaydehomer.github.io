    "section": "Metrics",
    "text": "Metrics\nSome of the information is obvious, but others I had to do some exploring to learn more about. Let’s review:\ndanceability: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\nenergy: Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.\nkey: The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class). Key_mode is a more helpful interpretation for us.\nloudness: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.\nmode: Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\nspeechiness: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.\nacousticness: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.\ninstrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.\nliveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\nvalence: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\ntempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration."

Taylor’s Version\nFor my first bit of exploration, I’m wondering how much a difference Taylor made in how Taylory Taylor is.\nFirst, let’s add a boolean that tells us if a song is Taylor’s Version. Dirty data problem 1 of ???: tick marks vs. apostrophes. And this is why we use unicode, friends.\n\nswifty <- swifty |> \n  mutate(isTV = str_detect(track_name, \"Taylor's Version|Taylor’s Version\")) \n\nNow that we have TV as it’s own variable, we can make our data one step closer to at least first normal form (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/normal-forms-in-dbms/) by making sure that track name contains only one type of information: the track name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: stringr\n\n\n\nStringr is one of my favorite tools in the tidyverse, especially for dealing with any sort of text data. Here I used:\n\nstr_remove() to remove (Taylor’s Version) from song titles to better group them later\nstr_squish() to remove any whitespace from the start and end, and reduce any double spaces within a song to a single space\nstr_to_lower() is the cute little sister of str_to_upper() and converts characters to lowercase\nstr_replace_all() replaces all of the target string (in this case all punctuation) with the replacement string (in this case nothingness)\n\n\n\n\nswifty <- swifty |> \n  mutate(track_name = str_remove(track_name, \"\\\\(Taylor's Version\\\\)|\\\\(Taylor’s Version\\\\)\"),\n         track_name = str_squish(track_name),\n         track_name = str_to_lower(track_name),\n         track_name = str_replace_all(track_name, \"[[:punct:]]\", \"\"))\n\nNow we can grab just our songs that have a TV and a no-TV.\n\nsongs_with_tvs <- swifty |> \n  group_by(track_name) |> \n  summarize(n = n(),\n            hasTV = sum(isTV)) |> \n  filter(n > 1 & hasTV > 0)\n\nLet’s take a look at danceability first. Looks like there is a general trend for Taylor’s Version of songs to be less danceable.\n\nswifty |> \n  filter(track_name %in% songs_with_tvs$track_name) |> \n  group_by(track_name, isTV) |> \n  summarize(dance = mean(danceability)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = isTV, y = dance, group = track_name)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_line(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\n– while I’m pretty confident in my brain’s ability to store endless lyrics, this website made possible all of the lyrics and references found throughout this project"

We can get it for our own account (maybe I’ll do that another time), but not for all users ever. But….\nIt’s hard to fight when thе fight ain’t fair We’re getting stronger now, find things they never found They might be bigger but we’re faster and never scared\nSo, yes, we can get streaming info. It’s just a bit of an adventure into Wonderland! I found and subscribed to a potentially-sketchy web API… https://rapidapi.com/developer/dashboard\nNow, I can pull streaming/playback info (caveat, only for 20 songs per day). So, this project will take a while to complete for streaming info. Unless Spotify allows us to pull streaming info for songs some time soon, which is doubtful, I’ll keep using this API I’m now subscribed to.\nThe following code queries the database (tbd on when that playback info is backdated?) using the track_id.\n\n# queryString <- list(spotify_track_id = \"XXXXXXXXXX\")\n# \n# response <- VERB(\"GET\", \n#                  url, \n#                  query = queryString, \n#                  add_headers('X-RapidAPI-Key' = '19547ae2bdmsh4d5cd37c8c39d7fp1a033bjsnaa6639064938', \n#                              'X-RapidAPI-Host' = 'spotify-track-streams-playback-count1.p.rapidapi.com'),\n#                  content_type(\"application/octet-stream\"))\n\ntest for Lavender Haze\ntrack id = 24emu3sabKISjRkrys28jq\n\n# queryString <- list(spotify_track_id = \"24emu3sabKISjRkrys28jq\")\n# \n# # response <- VERB(\"GET\", \n# #                  url, \n# #                  query = queryString, \n# #                  add_headers('X-RapidAPI-Key' = '19547ae2bdmsh4d5cd37c8c39d7fp1a033bjsnaa6639064938', \n# #                              'X-RapidAPI-Host' = 'spotify-track-streams-playback-count1.p.rapidapi.com'),\n# #                  content_type(\"application/octet-stream\"))\n# \n# content(response, \"text\")\n\nWhich results in a text list containing (among other things) the track_id and stream number, which we can add to our file somewhat manually, like so:\n\n# track_plays[4, 3] <- content(response)[4][[1]]\n# track_plays[4, 4] <- date()\n\nOf course I’d prefer not to do that for 465 songs, so let’s loop that shit.\nFirst, we want to set up a subset for N tracks that we want to get playback info for, so we don’t break the bank ($.50 per additional API call after 20… that’s more money than I have in my bank account!!!). Then we send that subset into the loop, get playback info for the track, add plaayback info and the date it was accessed to our track_plays file, rinse and repeat.\n\n# url <- \"https://spotify-track-streams-playback-count1.p.rapidapi.com/tracks/spotify_track_streams\"\n# \n# no_plays <- track_plays |> \n#   filter(is.na(plays)) |> \n#   head(6)\n# \n# for(t in 1:nrow(no_plays)){\n#   track <- no_plays[t, 1]\n#   queryString <- list(spotify_track_id = track$track_id)\n#   response <- VERB(\"GET\",\n#                    url,\n#                    query = queryString,\n#                    add_headers('X-RapidAPI-Key' = '19547ae2bdmsh4d5cd37c8c39d7fp1a033bjsnaa6639064938',\n#                                'X-RapidAPI-Host' = 'spotify-track-streams-playback-count1.p.rapidapi.com'),\n#                    content_type(\"application/octet-stream\"))\n#   track_plays[which(track_plays$track_id==track$track_id), 3] <- content(response)[4][[1]]\n#   track_plays[which(track_plays$track_id==track$track_id), 4] <- date()\n# }\n\n# in case need to do a manual entry \n#track_plays[which(track_plays$track_id==\"0GKDhq6ZbmSbRHd3eyGlB7\"), 3] <- 229475778\n\nI then write this file out to a csv to store it after each day’s API access is maxed so I can read it in and add more data the next day (so long as I remember to do so).

    "text": "Graduate students are drawn to Washington University in St. Louis from across the globe to contribute to the innovative research, scholarship, and high-impact creative practices. I am one of those driven graduate students and now I am writing to you to apply to the open data analyst position to assist in understanding graduate student education and academic support at Washington University in St. Louis. With nearly a decade of experience using R for statistical analyses, visualization, and reporting, and combined with my own graduate education at Washington University in St. Louis, I bring a wealth of statistical, professional, and practical knowledge that aligns with the vision of and Washington University in St. Louis of promoting educational excellence.\nI was excited to learn of this opportunity from my colleague at the Center for Teaching and Learning, Sally Wu. Under Sally’s guidance and in my role of graduate student data fellow I have analyzed data from a variety of vendors to understand the use of educational technologies at Wash U. My project management skills, creative problem solving skills, and understanding of issues in higher education have allowed me to succeed in balancing 5 or more projects to meet the needs of the team. Because all of the data comes from different vendors, I developed unique workflows for each project to clean, wrangle, and organize the data before any analyses are allowed. Sharing findings with CTL and IT stakeholders has given me an outlet to practice communication of complex information and meeting my audience where they are, building on skills I have honed in classroom teaching and presenting research to academics.\nAs a graduate student, I manage multiple projects in addition to my coursework, department milestones, teaching, and mentoring. For my masters project, I collected and managed hundreds of participant data for each experiment, but I also taught myself python to code the experiments when point-and-click software could not handle my design demands. I performed a variety of analyses using R and ensured the code was readable by producing an Rmarkdown file describing the goal for each chunk of code. When faced with setbacks, such as having access to data for my dissertation project rescinded after passing the proposal defense, I quickly launch into problem solving mode, using my network, critical thinking, and creativity to come up with a new project.\nIn all of my various roles, I consistently ensure those around me feel included and welcome, have equitable access, and can thrive in my presence. One of my core values is open-mindedness, which means I tend to see things from others’ points of view, enjoy engaging in novel experiences and interactions, and constantly expanding and revising my narrative of the world. Combined with my record of managing, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data I am confident I will productively contribute to advancing our understanding of the graduate student experience at Washington University in St. Louis.\nI look forward to arranging a time for us to speak about the role I can play on the Arts & Sciences data analysis team to continue advancing WashU’s values and goals as a world-class research enterprise, first-rate college, and impactful leader of St. Louis and the world.\nBest regards,\n\n\n\n\n\nJayde Homer"
